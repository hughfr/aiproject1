# GA Hyperparameter Tuning Scripts

This directory contains two scripts for tuning your Genetic Algorithm (GA) hyperparameters for Sudoku solving:

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `quick_ga_tuning.py` (Recommended for most users)
- **Purpose**: Fast hyperparameter tuning with minimal setup
- **Features**: 
  - Quick grid search with 8 predefined configurations
  - Random search with customizable number of trials
  - Early stopping and timeout mechanisms
  - Immediate results display
  - Simple JSON output

### 2. `ga_hyperparameter_tuning.py` (Advanced users)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning with advanced features
- **Features**:
  - Full grid search and random search
  - Parallel processing for faster evaluation
  - Statistical analysis and visualization
  - Support for multiple puzzles
  - Detailed result analysis

## Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Run the quick tuning script**:
   ```bash
   python quick_ga_tuning.py
   ```

2. **Choose your method**:
   - Option 1: Quick Grid Search (8 predefined configurations)
   - Option 2: Random Search (20 random configurations)

3. **Set timeout** (default 60 seconds per configuration)

4. **View results** - the script will show you the best configuration immediately

## Current GA Parameters (from your notebook)
```python
GA_POP = 300              # Population size
GA_CROSSOVER_RATE = 0.9   # Crossover rate
GA_MUTATION_RATE = 0.03   # Mutation rate
GA_TOURNAMENT_K = 5       # Tournament size
```

## Key Parameters Being Tuned

1. **Population Size** (`pop_size`): 50-300
   - Larger populations = more diversity but slower
   - Smaller populations = faster but less diversity

2. **Crossover Rate** (`crossover_rate`): 0.6-0.95
   - Higher rates = more exploration
   - Lower rates = more exploitation

3. **Mutation Rate** (`mutation_rate`): 0.01-0.1
   - Higher rates = more diversity but can disrupt good solutions
   - Lower rates = less diversity but preserves good solutions

4. **Tournament Size** (`tournament_k`): 3-10
   - Larger tournaments = stronger selection pressure
   - Smaller tournaments = weaker selection pressure

## Speed Optimizations

The scripts include several optimizations to make tuning faster:

1. **Early Stopping**: Stops when a solution is found
2. **Timeout**: Each configuration has a maximum runtime
3. **Reduced Generations**: Uses 300-500 generations instead of unlimited
4. **Parallel Processing**: (Advanced script only) Runs multiple configurations simultaneously

## Expected Results

- **Easy puzzles**: Should solve in 1-5 minutes with good parameters
- **Medium puzzles**: May take 5-15 minutes
- **Hard puzzles**: Could take 15+ minutes or may not solve

## Interpreting Results

Look for configurations that:
1. **Solve successfully** (success = True)
2. **Solve quickly** (low runtime)
3. **Use fewer decisions** (lower decision count)

## Example Output

```
üèÜ BEST CONFIGURATION:
   Population Size: 200
   Crossover Rate: 0.90
   Mutation Rate: 0.05
   Tournament K: 7
   Runtime: 45.2 seconds
   Decisions: 12500
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Import errors**: Make sure `sudoku_solver2.ipynb` is in the same directory
2. **File not found**: Check that puzzle files exist in `puzzles/` directory
3. **Timeout issues**: Increase timeout if configurations are taking too long
4. **No solutions found**: Try different parameter ranges or increase generations

## Next Steps

After finding good parameters:
1. Test them on multiple puzzles
2. Fine-tune around the best configuration
3. Consider puzzle-specific tuning for different difficulty levels
4. Implement the best parameters in your main GA code
